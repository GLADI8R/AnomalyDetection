# Anomaly Detection

This project aims at learning about anomalies and detecting anomalies using machine learning.

Here creditcard transaction dataset is used and isolation forest is used with a flavor of unsupervised and supervised learning. PCA and t-SNE algorithms are also implemented to visualise the outliers nad inliers.
